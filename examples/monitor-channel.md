# Monitor a channel for new uploads

**Prompt**

> Every morning, check if @mkbhd posted a new video. If yes, summarize it for
> me.

**What the agent does**

1. Polls the latest-uploads endpoint — **free, no credit ever**:

```bash
curl -s "https://bulktranscripts.co/api/v1/channel/latest?channel=@mkbhd"
```

2. Compares each result's `published` timestamp against the last check (keep a
   cursor in a scratch file, e.g. `~/.cache/yt-monitor/mkbhd.last`).
3. Only for genuinely new videos, fetches the transcript (1 credit) and
   summarizes:

```bash
curl -s "https://bulktranscripts.co/api/v1/transcript?video=NEW_VIDEO_ID&segments=0"
```

**Why this pattern**

The check itself is free because it rides YouTube's RSS feed — so a daily
monitor costs credits only on days the creator actually posts. Watching three
channels daily for a month typically costs a handful of credits total.

**Scaling up**: the same loop works in cron, n8n, or Make — see
https://bulktranscripts.co/integrations for node-by-node setups.
